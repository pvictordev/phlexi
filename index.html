              SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of optimizing
              a website to improve its visibility on search engines like Google.
              It involves various techniques to enhance a site's ranking in
              search results. SEO is crucial for online businesses as it helps
              drive organic traffic, increases visibility, and ultimately leads
              to higher conversions.

              The timeline for seeing results from SEO can vary based on several
              factors, such as the competitiveness of keywords, the current
              state of the website, and the effectiveness of the SEO strategy.
              Generally, it may take several weeks to months before noticeable
              improvements occur. However, long-term commitment to SEO is
              essential for sustained success.

            <div class="accordion-item-desc">
              Mobile optimization is crucial for SEO because search engines
              prioritize mobile-friendly websites. With the increasing use of
              smartphones, search engines like Google consider mobile
              responsiveness as a ranking factor. Websites that provide a

              Backlinks, or inbound links from other websites to yours, play a
              significant role in SEO. They are considered a vote of confidence
              and can improve a site's authority. Quality over quantity is
              crucial when acquiring backlinks. Strategies for obtaining
              backlinks include creating high-quality content, guest posting,
              reaching out to industry influencers, and participating in
              community activities. It's important to focus on natural and
              ethical link-building practices.
