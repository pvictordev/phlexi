# Software Academy Project

## Freelance Services Platform

This project represents a Freelance Services Platform built during the training program at Software Academy. Each stage of the project has its own version, allowing you to track its progress with each step.

### Stage #1 (HTML & CSS)

Using plain HTML and CSS, we create the initial interface. This stage forms the basis for further development, shaping the platform's overall look and feel.

### Stage #2 (JavaScript)

Introducing JavaScript functionality to enhance interactivity, we have added functionalities like a slideshow, implemented form validation, created a new page where we fetched data from a public API, added form validation together with saving data as JSON in local storage and included a counter to count each submission.

### Stage #3 (Bootstrap)

We implemented the Bootstrap framework by replacing all CSS classes with corresponding Bootstrap classes. We maintained the design and JavaScript functionality of the website, integrating new Bootstrap classes and interactivity. Additionally, we introduced a dark mode functionality and spinner loader to enhance the user experience.

### Stage #4 (PHP & MySQL)

At that stage, we created the database for the app. Following that, we developed the database schema. Subsequently, we refactored the entire HTML code, replacing it with PHP, following to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. We've implemented new functionalities such as user sign-up and sign-in, user profile management including editing and updating user information, adding skills for specific users, and project management capabilities including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). All changes adhere to industry best practices, such as naming conventions for files and folders and adopting the MVC (Model-View-Controller) software design pattern. Security measures include password hashing during user registration and middleware to redirect users based on their role (logged in or logged out).
