# Software Academy Project

## Freelance Services Platform

This project represents a Freelance Services Platform built during the training program at Software Academy. Each stage of the project has its own version, allowing you to track its progress with each step.

### Stage #1 (HTML & CSS)

Using plain HTML and CSS, we create the initial interface. This stage forms the basis for further development, shaping the platform's overall look and feel.

### Stage #2 (JavaScript)

Introducing JavaScript functionality to enhance interactivity, we have added functionalities like a slideshow, implemented form validation, created a new page where we fetched data from a public API, added form validation together with saving data as JSON in local storage and included a counter to count each submission.

### Stage #3 (Bootstrap)

We implemented the Bootstrap framework by replacing all CSS classes with corresponding Bootstrap classes. We maintained the design and JavaScript functionality of the website, integrating new Bootstrap classes and interactivity. Additionally, we introduced a dark mode functionality and spinner loader to enhance the user experience.
