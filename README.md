# Software Academy Project

## Freelance Services Platform

This project represents a Freelance Services Platform built during the training program at Software Academy. Each stage of the project has its own version, allowing you to track its progress with each step.

### Stage #1 (HTML & CSS)
Using plain HTML and CSS, we create the initial interface. This stage forms the basis for further development, shaping the platform's overall look and feel.
